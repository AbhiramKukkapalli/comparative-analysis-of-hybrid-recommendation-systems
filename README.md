# Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Recommendation Systems for Telugu News Content

## Overview
This repository hosts the complete work of my project on the development and analysis of hybrid recommendation systems, specifically tailored for Telugu language news content. The project integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with advanced recommendation algorithms, including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of news recommendations.

The primary goal of this project was to address the gap in NLP research and applications for regional languages, with a focus on Telugu. By employing a combination of different recommendation strategies, we aimed to create a system that not only understands the intricacies of the Telugu language but also aligns with user preferences effectively.

## Repository Contents
- `comparative-analysis-of-hybrid-recommendation-syst.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code used for developing, implementing, and evaluating the hybrid recommendation models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation.
- `Comparative Analysis of Hybrid Recommendation Systems for Telugu.pdf`: A comprehensive research paper that details the methodology, findings, and conclusions of our project. It covers the theoretical background, the specifics of the implementation, the evaluation results, and the implications of our work.
- `User_data_application`: A folder containing the Streamlit application code, along with `user_data.csv` and `user_rating.csv` files. These files are crucial for the application to function correctly and are used for comparing the performance of different recommendation systems.

## Key Features
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilization of NLP for processing and understanding Telugu language text, enabling accurate content analysis for recommendations.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithms**: Combination of content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and SVD-based matrix factorization to create a robust recommendation system.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: A user-friendly interface designed with Streamlit for user interaction, data retrieval, and real-time system evaluation.
- **Real-Time User Data Interaction**: The project captures real-time user data and feedback, which are integral to the continuous improvement of the recommendation algorithms.

## How to Use
1. **Hybrid_Recommendation_Systems.ipynb**: 
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use an IDE that supports `.ipynb` files like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
   - Install necessary libraries as listed in the notebook.
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the flow and workings of the recommendation algorithms.

2. **Project_Paper.pdf**:
   - Open the file with any standard PDF reader to access the detailed documentation of the project.
   - Recommended for readers interested in the theoretical background, detailed methodology, and comprehensive analysis of the project results.

3. **User_data_application**:
   - Navigate to the `User_data_application` folder to access the Streamlit application code.
   - Run the Streamlit app to interact with the recommendation systems and view real-time data.
   - Utilize the `user_data.csv` and `user_rating.csv` for a detailed comparison of system performances.
